Going into this project, I had a decent amount of React.js, HTML, CSS and JS experience. I also tinkered with MUI and had the general gist of it. Some projects that I did before this were the typical To-Do list and Pokedex mockup, so nothing extraordinary. I felt the above was somewhat easy, so I wanted to challenge myself to a bigger project. One that I could apply to the real world and a potential client if needed. That's where this project comes into play: the Nike Knockoff Ecommerce site. 

I'm not going to sugarcoat this experience. It was challenging. Going from CRA (create-react-app) to Next.js made things easier since Next is an amazing boilerplate, but I did face some hurdles. Learning all the npm packages needed to make an Ecommersite site (next-connect, jsonwebtoken, next-connect) and structuring a big project with multiple pages and components was intimidating. However, once I broke down the tasks to do and components to complete each day, the process became easier. If I could complete a task everyday, that gave me confidence to complete all the other tasks until the Ecommerce site was finally complete. 

So what did I gain from this experience? I learned: 
- How Next.js works. 
- Connect to a backend database (Sanity) and how to communicate with it
- Display information from an API
- Create a database that has multiple products and sell those products using a payment method
- Deploy a site using Vercel
- Use a CSS library to create a responsive UI and streamline production
- ...and many more things.
